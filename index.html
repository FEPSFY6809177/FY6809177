        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This paper discusses the history of the development of the engine chronologically, starting with external combustion engines to looking at more recently innovated ideas such as hydrogen fuel and battery electric cars. It starts by exploring the Savery steam pump engine, and the design and drawbacks of the early steam engine. Moving forward, the paper talks about how internal combustion engines operate and the properties of fuels and their impact on engine performance. Finally, the essay finishes by introducing alternatives to combustion engines, and the principles of how fuel cells and batteries work. </p>

    <!-- External Combustion Section -->
    <section id="ExtCombustion">
        <h2>External Combustion</h2>
        <p>The first development of an engine was the steam pump, which operated utilising the difference of volume in water and vapour. Thomas Savery “discovered that the weight of the outside atmosphere, with its higher pressure than the vacuum in the machine, creates an energy force which can be used to move something from one place to another”​ (Cartwright, 2023)​. This force caused by the difference in the low internal pressure and high external pressure can be used to counter the force of gravity acting on an object, in this case, it was designed to move water up. It functioned by heating water “under great pressure in the boiler, then let into the cylinder where it forced the water upwards. The steam was then condensed using a jet of cold water, and the next load of water was let into the receiver”.​ (Science Museum Group, n.d.)​. The Savery Engine had a lot of flaws and “suffered from low thermal efficiency, great weight and bulk, and inconvenience of operation”,​ (Britannica, 2019)​ this was due to needing a furnace running to maintain a high temperature to achieve high pressure for the steam to travel.</p>

    <!-- Internal Combustion Section -->
    <section id="IntCombustion">
        <h2>Internal Combustion</h2>
        <p>Petrol and diesel engines differ from steam engines as combustions occur within the engine instead of in a furnace or boiler outside of the system, proving it to be more efficient, it’s known as internal combustion as the heat does not have to travel. The first internal combustion engine was innovated by Étienne Lenoir, it was a simple 2 stroke system. “In the first half of the first stroke was a mixture of 6% city gas and 94% air was sucked in and ignited with a spark plug.”. Igniting the air-fuel mixture creates an exothermic reaction, which produces a force that pushes the piston outward. “During the second stroke, the burned mixture is extruded”.​ (V.O. Patents and Trademarks, 2019)​ A regular petrol engine has four strokes; intake, compression, power and exhaust. In the first stroke, the intake valves open to take in the fuel mix, and in the compression stroke, the piston pushes to compress the fuel. It then is ignited with the spark plug, which forces the piston down, and finally the exhaust valves open and the piston pushes out the burned gas. This is different to a diesel system which would ignite without the need for a spark plug. </p>
        <p>Invented by German engineer Rudolf Diesel, diesel engines differ slightly, as there is first only air in the cylinder, then once compressed (at a higher compression ratio than petrol), “finely atomised fuel is sprayed into the air”, this mix under high pressure is enough to cause “a series of spontaneous chemical reactions that result in a self-ignition.”​ (Knothe, Krahl, & Gerpen, 2010)​ </p>

    <!-- Characteristics Section -->

    <section id="charFuel">
    <h2>Characteristics of a Fuel</h2>
    <p>An optimal fuel is dependent on the physical properties of the fuel which affect the flow rate, and chemical properties to determine how much energy is produced. These are “viscosity, density, calorific value, flash point and cetane number”.​ (M.I. Arbab, et al., 2013)​ . The calorific value of a fuel, also known as the heat of combustion, is the amount of energy that is produced when it is completely oxidised. Having a fuel with higher calorific value will be more efficient. Fuels with different densities and viscosities influence the performance of the engine, in diesels, the viscosity of a fuel affects the quality of the fuel spray formation, droplet size and quality of combustion.​ (Todoruț, Molea, & Barabás, 2020)​ If a fuel is too viscose, more force is required from the injector to allow self-ignition. Environmental factors are also important, for example, in 2021, standard petrol in the UK changed to E10, where more ethanol was mixed in to reduce emissions​ (gov.uk, 2022)​ </p>

    <!-- Future Section -->

    <section id="future">
    <h2>Future Fuels</h2>
    <p>Water may be a better alternative to petrol and diesel both fuels produce emissions which are harmful to the environment, whereas when using a hydrogen fuel cell, only water vapour is produced and heat as a by-product. Fuel cells in cars are generally polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, where there is a cathode and anode with electrolyte in between. They are used to create electricity from hydrogen fuel. “Hydrogen is introduced to the anode, and oxygen (from air) is introduced to the cathode.” ​(U.S. Department of Energy - Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, n.d.)​ At the anode, the hydrogen is oxidised, and the cathode is exposed to oxygen. As the hydrogen is oxidised, the protons travel across the PEM to the cathode. The negative ions left from the hydrogen at the anode are attracted to the positive ions however, they are forced to travel around a circuit which induces a current. </p>
    <p>Vehicles which use hydrogen fuel cells are known as HFEV [Hydrogen Fuel Electric Vehicles] which are upcoming in EVs against BEVs [Battery Electric Vehicles]. Most BEVs use lithium-ion batteries to hold charge. Lithium-ion batteries also use a similar system to hydrogen fuel cells, where there is an anode and cathode with a separator in between and the movement of the ions between the electrodes induce the current to produce electricity. When charging, the ions move back to their original position to the anode. Although there are little to no pollutants in hydrogen powered cars, it does not make them environmentally friendly. This is because generally hydrogen is not produced through electrolysis in the industry, as it cannot meet demands. Hydrogen is currently mainly produced from natural gas and results in an emissions intensity in the range of 10-14 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kg H<sub>2</sub> ​(IEA, 2023)​ Most emissions are caused from using methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. This makes BEVs more appealing for some road users as they can ensure that their source of energy is renewable. In addition to this, there are regular charging points in the UK for BEVs to use, compared to places to refill hydrogen fuel tanks. On the other hand, hydrogen tanks take a similar amount of time as combustion engines to refill, compared to hours required to wait for a BEV to recharge.  </p>
