    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Since the 20th Century, we have come from using animals and mechanical power to using machines and doing work using other energy sources. The first development of an engine was the steam pump, which operated utilising the difference of volume in water and vapour. Thomas Savery “discovered that the weight of the outside atmosphere, with its higher pressure than the vacuum in the machine, creates an energy force which can be used to move something from one place to another” (Cartwright, 2023). This force caused by the difference in the low internal pressure and high external pressure can be used to counter the force of gravity acting on an object, in this case, it was designed to move water up. It functioned by heating water “under great pressure in the boiler, then let into the cylinder where it forced the water upwards. The steam was then condensed using a jet of cold water, and the next load of water was let into the receiver”. (Science Museum Group, n.d.). The Savery Engine had a lot of flaws and “suffered from low thermal efficiency, great weight and bulk, and inconvenience of operation”, (Britannica, 2019) this was due to needing a furnace running to maintain a high temperature to achieve high pressure for the water vapour to travel.</p>
        <h3>Internal Combustion Engines</h3>
        <p>Petrol and diesel engines differ from steam engines as combustions occur within the engine instead of in a furnace or boiler outside of the system, proving it to be more efficient, it is known as internal combustion as the heat does not have to travel. The first internal combustion engine was innovated by Étienne Lenoir, it was a simple 2 stroke system. “In the first half of the first stroke was a mixture of 6% city gas and 94% air was sucked in and ignited with a spark plug.”. Igniting the air-fuel mixture creates an exothermic reaction, which produces a force that pushes the piston outward. “During the second stroke, the burned mixture is extruded”. (V.O. Patents and Trademarks, 2019) This is different to a diesel system which would ignite without the need for a spark plug. </p>

        <p>Invented by German engineer Rudolf Diesel, diesel engines differ slightly, as there is first only air in the cylinder, then once compressed (at a higher compression ratio than petrol), “finely atomised fuel is sprayed into the air”, this mix under high pressure is enough to cause “a series of spontaneous chemical reactions that result in a self-ignition or autoignition.” (Knothe, et al., 2010)</p>

    <!-- Alternatives Section -->
    <section id="analysis">
        <h2>Alternatives</h2>
        <p>An optimal fuel must be able to produce a lot of energy and quickly. Factors that include this include the physical properties of the fuel which affect the flow rate, and chemical properties to determine how much energy is produced. These are “viscosity, density, caloric value, flash point and cetane number”. (M.I. Arbab, et al., 2013) . </p>
        <p>Water is already used to produce energy in the world, through hydroelectricity, for example the Three Gorges Dam in China which utilises the Yangtze River to generate 101.6 billion kilowatt hours in 2018 (China News Network, 2019). For a car, water would be used to extract hydrogen which could then be used to power the vehicle via a fuel cell which converts the hydrogen into electricity.
            This is a better alternative to petrol and diesel as they both produce emissions which are harmful to the environment, whereas using a hydrogen fuel cell, only water vapour is produced and heat as a by-product. Fuel cells in cars are generally polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, where there is a cathode and anode with electrolyte in between. “Hydrogen is introduced to the anode, and oxygen (from air) is introduced to the cathode.” (U.S. Department of Energy - Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, n.d.)</p>
