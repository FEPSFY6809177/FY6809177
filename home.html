        <h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Since the 20th Century, we have come from using animals and mechanical power to using machines and doing work using other energy sources. The first development of an engine was the steam pump, which operated utilising the difference of volume in water and vapour. Thomas Savery “discovered that the weight of the outside atmosphere, with its higher pressure than the vacuum in the machine, creates an energy force which can be used to move something from one place to another” (Cartwright, 2023). This force caused by the difference in the low internal pressure and high external pressure can be used to counter the force of gravity acting on an object, in this case, it was designed to move water up. It functioned by heating water “under great pressure in the boiler, then let into the cylinder where it forced the water upwards. The steam was then condensed using a jet of cold water, and the next load of water was let into the receiver”. (Science Museum Group, n.d.). The Savery Engine had a lot of flaws and “suffered from low thermal efficiency, great weight and bulk, and inconvenience of operation”, (Britannica, 2019) this was due to needing a furnace running to maintain a high temperature to achieve high pressure for the water vapour to travel.
DIESEL AND PETROL</p>
<p>
Petrol and diesel engines differ from steam engines as combustions occur within the engine instead of in a furnace or boiler outside of the system, proving it to be more efficient. The first internal combustion engine was innovated by Étienne Lenoir, it was a simple 2 stroke system. “In the first half of the first stroke was a mixture of 6% city gas and 94% air was sucked in and ignited with a spark plug.”. Igniting the air-fuel mixture creates an exothermic reaction, which produces a force that pushes the piston outward. “During the second stroke, the burned mixture is extruded”. (V.O. Patents and Trademarks, 2019)
